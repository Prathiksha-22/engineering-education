Decrypting Ransomware: Quick recovery guide

Here is the scenario.

You are working on your computer and you notice that your computer seems slow. Or, perhaps you may not be able to access pre-existing documents or media files.

You may receive a Windows error message that says the file is &quot;unknown file type&quot; or &quot;Windows cannot open the file.&quot;

If you&#39;re using a Mac, you can see the message &quot;No related software&quot; or &quot;No program created to open documents&quot;.

Another possibility is that the system is completely closed. If you&#39;re in the office, you can see if others have the same problem. Some are been prohibited, others are now wondering what is happening, just like you.

Then you will see a message confirming your concern.

You&#39;ve been infected with ransomware.

This scenario would be the worst if you have lot of businesses.

Ransomware is generally spread by spam or phishing. It can also transferred via websites or by downloading zip documents. This would penetrate the network. Infection methods are constantly changing. There are many other ways you can get infected. Finally, malware requires a ransomware (generally paid for bitcoin). This is to decrypt files and restore the full operations of the affected IT systems.

What should you do next?

Here are the ways that you can follow to remove the ransomware.

1. Isolate the infection

2. Identify the infection

3. Report

4. Determine your options

5. Restore and refresh

6. Plan to prevent for recurrence

1 — Isolate the Infection

If an infected computer is complained of, the first step is to exclude it from other computers. Then it&#39;s storage devices. Disconnect from the Internet (cable and Wi-Fi) and all external storage devices. Crypto Worm is actively searching for connections. And other computers too, so you want to prevent this from happening. You don&#39;t even want ransomware to communicate with control centers on the Internet.

2 — Identify the Infection

Choose a root program. This will help you understand the

-type of deletion,

-how it spreads,

-the types of encrypted files,

-what your options are for deleting and deleting them.

The General Chat Lounge will also allow you to notify the authorities of the attack. There are many sites that help you identify the ransomware, including ID Ransomware. The No More Ransomware! Project provides the Crypto Sheriff to help identify ransomware.

3 — Report

It will benefit everyone by informing the powerful authorities about the ransomware. The FBI requires victims of ransomware to report ransomware incidents. Victim reports provide a better understanding of the

-threat to law enforcement,

-justify ransomware investigations, and

-contribute information related to ongoing ransomware cases. Knowing more about the victim&#39;s experiences with ransomware will help the FBI. This is to determine who is behind the attacks and how to identify or attack the victims.

You can report to the FBI at the Internet Claims Center.

There are other ways to report ransomware.

4 — Determine Your Options

You have several ways to deal with an infection. Decide which method is best for you.

Your options when infected with ransomware are:

· Pay the ransom

· Try to remove malware

· Delete the system (s) and reinstall it again

Generally, it is a bad idea to pay the ransom. This encourages more ransomware, and often unlocking encrypted files is not successful. This leads you to decide from the other two options.

5 — Restore and refresh

You will need to reinstall operating system applications. And software from source or internet media. Manage your account and program credentials. This should be able to reactivate accounts for applications. Use a password manager. This is to store your account numbers, usernames, passwords and other basic information. You can access that information through their web interface or mobile applications. You just need to make sure you still know the main username and password to access these programs.

6 — Plan to prevent for recurrence

Assess how the infection is occurred and what you can do to prevent it from happening again.

Ransomware attacks continue to evolve, and attack methods become more sophisticated than ever. You don&#39;t need to be part of the stats. Have a good plan and smart practices, you can prevent runtime from affecting your system.

Measures to tackle ransomware:

1. Use antivirus, anti-malware, or other security policies. This is to prevent anonymous downloads.

2. Save offline backup copies. The data stored on sites accessed by potentially affected computers. This includes unwanted external or cloud storage drives. This would prevent them from accessing the remote control.

3. Install the latest security updates from the operating system vendor and application software.

4. Consider setting up a security program. This to protect endpoints, email servers, and network systems from infection.

5. Divide your networks to keep isolated PCs and prevent spread of malware in case of attack. Turn off unnecessary network shares.

6. Learn about the best systems to keep malware out of your system.

It seems that the best way to respond to a ransom attack is to avoid having it. Besides, make sure that your valuable data cannot get access through backups. Ensure least downloads and data loss.
